In Oracle, handling of character sets and the storage of characters in VARCHAR2 columns (which is the equivalent of VARCHAR in other databases) depends on the character set defined for the database.

Character Set: Oracle supports several character sets, including WE8ISO8859P1 (Western European 8-bit, similar to Latin-1), AL32UTF8 (UTF-8 encoding), and others.

Single Character Storage:

If your Oracle database is using a single-byte character set like WE8ISO8859P1, each character in the 0-255 range will be stored as a single byte. Therefore, any character in the extended ASCII range will fit into a VARCHAR2(1) column.
If your Oracle database is using a multi-byte character set like AL32UTF8, characters in the extended ASCII range (0-255) will still typically be stored as a single character. UTF-8 encoding uses one byte for characters in the ASCII range (0-127) and more bytes for characters beyond that. However, Oracle treats VARCHAR2(n) as n characters, not n bytes, meaning you can store any single extended ASCII character in a VARCHAR2(1) column.
Example
If your database character set is WE8ISO8859P1:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE example_table (
    single_char_column VARCHAR2(1)
);

INSERT INTO example_table (single_char_column) VALUES ('é');  -- é is extended ASCII, code 233
If your database character set is AL32UTF8:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE example_table (
    single_char_column VARCHAR2(1 CHAR)
);

INSERT INTO example_table (single_char_column) VALUES ('é');  -- é in UTF-8 is two bytes, but one character
Verification
You can check your database character set with the following query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT parameter, value
FROM nls_database_parameters
WHERE parameter = 'NLS_CHARACTERSET';
Conclusion
In Oracle, a VARCHAR2(1) column will store any single character from the extended ASCII range (0-255) as long as the character set used by the database supports it. For multi-byte character sets like AL32UTF8, a single extended ASCII character will still be considered one character.

To check the character set of your Oracle database, you can use the following SQL query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT parameter, value 
FROM nls_database_parameters 
WHERE parameter = 'NLS_CHARACTERSET';
This will return the character set used by your database. For example, it might return AL32UTF8, WE8MSWIN1252, or another character set depending on how your database is configured.

Additionally, you can check the national character set with:

sql
Copy code
SELECT parameter, value 
FROM nls_database_parameters 
WHERE parameter = 'NLS_NCHAR_CHARACTERSET';
These queries will give you the necessary information about the character set configurations of your Oracle database​​​​​​.
